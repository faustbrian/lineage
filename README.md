# Lineage

Closure table hierarchies for Eloquent models with O(1) ancestor/descendant queries.

Lineage implements the closure table pattern for managing hierarchical relationships in Laravel. This enables efficient queries for ancestors and descendants without recursion limits, supporting deeply nested relationships like organizational charts, sales hierarchies, and category trees.
